# Project of The Month (November 2018)

## What's this?
This website was created by the community of Zero to Mastery and is run by 100% by the community. **Fun fact**: It was initially developed by the 6 moderators that started our community back in the day on Slack (before we moved to Discord). We want to turn this project into a resource for the community and a place to gather all of our open source initiatives (see below).

## Who can participate?
Anybody! Think of this as a playground where no matter what your skill level, you can contribure (see the Git and Github section of the Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery if this is your first time contributing to open source) to this project and nobody is going to yell at you if you make a mistake :)

## What is the project?
Re-developing  https://zerotomastery.io/  

**A Note from Andrei: This is 100% a community run (0 involvement from me) from day 1 and all procceeds from this website go into supporting our open source projects (i.e. hosting, domains).**

## Intro
The aim of this month's community challenge is to re-develop the Zero To Mastery Website. Not only to make this a great place for new potential students to find out more, but for potential employers to scout talent and finally for students to find everything the community has to offer.

In short, the aim is to re-develop the site to encompass all the fragmented sections of ZTM into a single website.

## Features
**Courses Page**
A page containing details of each course, some reviews and sign up buttons. 
Udemy's API, might be something we could use in this.

**Group Projects**
Listing all the group projects available, what language/tech they use. Also information on getting started and FAQs. Utilise the Github API to fetch data such as contributors and total PRs, maybe.

**Coding Challenges**
List all previous coding challenges & entries, utilising a JSON file structure to allow adding new challenges quickly and easily. Making it easier for new students to go back and try previous challenges. 

**Job Board**
Integrate the Job Board

**Resources**
Integrate the Resources Website

**Discord**
Information about the Discord Community, along with guides on using Discord.
