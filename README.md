# Project of The Month (November 2018)

## What's this?
This website was created by the community of Zero to Mastery and is run by 100% by the community. **Fun fact**: It was initially developed by the 6 moderators that started our community back in the day on Slack (before we moved to Discord). We want to turn this project into a resource for the community and a place to gather all of our open source initiatives (see below).

## Who can participate?
Anybody! Think of this as a playground where no matter what your skill level, you can contribure (see the Git and Github section of the Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery if this is your first time contributing to open source) to this project and nobody is going to yell at you if you make a mistake :)

## What is the project?
Re-developing  https://zerotomastery.io/  

**A Note from Andrei: This is 100% a community run (0 involvement from me) from day 1 and all procceeds from this website go into supporting our open source projects (i.e. hosting, domains).**

## Intro
Zero-to-Mastery and the community has grown into so much more than than ever could have been imagined when this project was first created. Each month brings many more new students to the community with many new ideas, leaving this website and project, outdated and under utilised. 

The aim of this event is to bring together all that ZTM has to offer, into a single weblication. A community portal, where students a like can find reources they may not have known existed before now.

## Features
**Courses Page**
A page containing details of each course, some reviews and sign up buttons. 
Udemy's API, might be something we could use in this.

**Group Projects** (https://github.com/zero-to-mastery)
Listing all the group projects available, what language/tech they use. Also information on getting started and FAQs. Utilise the Github API to fetch data such as contributors and total PRs, maybe.

**Coding Challenges** 
List all previous coding challenges & entries, utilising a JSON file structure to allow adding new challenges quickly and easily. Making it easier for new students to go back and try previous challenges.
